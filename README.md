Alfred: RCRemote
================

Alfred is the name of my High School Final Project, which I built together with [Douwe Maan](https://github.com/DouweM). 

Alfred is, simply put, a robot car that can be controlled remotely using a smartphone.

The robot car is built using LEGOs, with a LEGO NXT brick running the [leJOS NXJ](http://lejos.sourceforge.net/) operating system as it's brain.
It can be controlled by using an Android phone like a steering wheel.

This project, dubbed RCRemote, is the application running on the Android phone. Its counterpart leJOS NXJ app can be found [here](https://github.com/DouweM/RCCar).
